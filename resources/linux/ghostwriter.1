.SH NAME
ghostwriter \- distraction\-free text editor for Markdown
.SH SYNOPSIS
ghostwriter [file]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Qt text editing application for Markdown that provides an aesthetic,
distraction\-free writing environment.
Create your own custom themes, write in fullscreen mode, or use focus mode
to concentrate on just one or more lines.
A live HTML preview allows you to view the final formatting as you type.
HTML preview and export options are provided by the built-in Markdown processor,
cmark-gfm;  but you may add more by installing Pandoc, MultiMarkdown,
or cmark processors.  The application will automatically detect their
installation if their locations are in the system's PATH environment variable.
